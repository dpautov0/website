	<b>Who I am:</b>
	<br>	
	Hello, My name is Dmitriy Pautov, and I am a physics student & hobbyist. This website is a place for me to share my ideas and document my work. Professionally, I've worked at Northwestern's physics lab on the EDM experiment and am currently exploring new opportunities. Personally, I dabble in electronics, 3D printing, CAD modeling, programming, and more.

	<br> 
	<b>Why Physics:</b>
	<br>
        The light-emitting diodes and transistors used to display this text, the electrical and light signals used to transmit this text over hundreds of miles, the stars that sparkle millions of miles away as I write this text; all are born from physics. Yet there are remaining mysteries: What is dark matter? Why does the cosmos expand? Does the elusive theory of everything exist? This is why I am studying physics—if what we know now is so spectacular, what remains in the unkowns of physics?
