        <h2> Turbomolecular pump driver </h2>

        <p>
       	Turbomolecular Pumps, TMPs for short, are a type of secondary vacuum pumps, meaning that they only pump from a rough vacuum to a higher one. TMPs are the most popular type of secondary pump, since they are clean (do not spew oil like diffusion pumps) and are relatively tolerant to conditions & easy to use (unlike more exotic ones, like cryogenic pumps). TMPs are dirt cheap on eBay, but drivers for them are challenging and or expensive to find. Considering that TMPs are just big BLDC motors, building one is not terrinly challenging.

          There have been a few attempts, lile [] or [].
          These are bad solutions.
          This is meant to be a more finalized solution.
